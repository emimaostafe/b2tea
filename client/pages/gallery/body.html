            <p>Say hello to FireFox and Pixel, the charming cats who have made our tea shop their home.
                FireFox, with her vibrant orange coat and wild energy, is always ready to play and keep everyone on
                their
                toes.
                While FireFox is always ready for action (just like an orange cat), Pixel is a more laid-back cat
                who
                enjoys
                spending his days napping and lounging around the shop. Together, these two furry friends bring joy
                and
                warmth
                to our tea-loving community, and we couldn't imagine our shop without them.
            </p>
